# 🧁 Golden Whisk Bakery: FP&A Portfolio Project

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently **in progress**. The foundational dataset and core financial analysis are complete. Data visualizations and advanced financial metrics (e.g., EBITDA, ROI, variance reporting) are being actively developed in Tableau and Power BI. This repository will be updated regularly with new deliverables and business insights.

**Last updated:** June 2025

## 📚 Project Overview

**Golden Whisk Bakery** is a *fictitious* retail and wholesale bakery brand operating in multiple regions. The company offers a diverse product catalog, including seasonal items, gluten-free options, and high-margin custom orders.

This project was developed to simulate a **Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)** scenario using a **synthetically generated dataset**, created in Python. The analysis emulates real-world business intelligence work and highlights how financial, sales, and product-level data can be leveraged to inform strategy.

The goal is to demonstrate core FP&A competencies:  

- 📈 Revenue analysis and forecasting  
- 💸 Product and category profitability  
- 📊 Budget variance and scenario modeling  
- 🧠 Strategic recommendations supported by data

---

## 🎯 Key Business Questions

This analysis is guided by practical questions faced by FP&A and analytics teams:

- **📊 What are the monthly trends by product category?**  
  Are there seasonal spikes or long-term patterns?

- **📈 What is the year-over-year growth by region or customer segment?**  
  Are we expanding or contracting in specific markets?

- **🥇 What are our best and worst performing products over time?**  
  Which items contribute most (or least) to revenue and volume?

- **🧮 How do actuals compare to budget and forecast?**  
  Where are we underperforming or exceeding expectations?

- **📉 Which product lines are most profitable?**  
  What are the margins and ROI per category or SKU?
